Code and Data Files Related to my Senior Thesis

For more info about background, methods, and results, see the PDF of Final Thesis. All RNA-Seq and fgsea analyses for which I did not write original code, were done in Galaxy. More information on this can be found in the thesis beginning on page 29. Most of the code needed can be found in the 'THESIS_CODE', 'Analysis of Brandon's Data', or 'GSEA' folders. Each python or R file contains a header describing their purpose and the files needed to run them.

Much of the output data is described either in the results section of the thesis or in the 'THESIS_DATA' or 'Results Images' folders.
